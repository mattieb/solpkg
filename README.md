solpkg
====

solpkg is a very old effort of mine to mimic the
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) ports system on Solaris, which I
used to use extensively back in the day.

The impetus for creating solpkg was that while open-source software
was freely available, it was distributed in binary form with no
way to make small changes to the builds.  I wanted to have a system
available where I could dive in and tweak the builds as needed.
This turned out to be the precursor to [a long obsession in software
packaging](https://www.zigg.com/2014/slides-rpm-talk-devops-west-michigan.html)â€¦

I had some trouble with the actual package builds on modern Solaris.
There's probably some fairly basic dependency and version-updating
work to get it working again.  If you get it working, please do let
me know!
