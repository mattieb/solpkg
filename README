Welcome to the Solaris Package System ("solpkg").

solpkg is a framework for easily turning a typical Open Source
application from its source tarball into a proper Solaris package.  It
is also a repository of several recipes to do this with some of the
more popular packages.

solpkg is loosely modeled after OpenBSD's ports system, which in turn
is a descendant of FreeBSD's ports system.  solpkg is still in its
infancy and is definitely not as full-featured as either of these (most
notably missing are automatic pulling of dependencies and source
tarball fetching), but it has the advantage of working on a stock
Solaris box with nothing other than a C compiler.

Quick start:

1.  Put the source tarball for the appropriate package into DIST.

2.  cd to the directory for the package you want to build.

3.  Run make as a normal user.

4.  Run make package as root.
